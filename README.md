# IBM'S OPENS SCIENCE PRIZE | 2021

## Abstract 

Our proposed solution to the IBMâ€™s open science prize 2021 is simply to apply an error mitigation process. We
will use a technique well known in the field of high energy physics called the iterative Bayesian unfolding. But we
will apply it through a new way which will greatly increases its error-mitigation capacities. Our solution is short,
simple and fast.
